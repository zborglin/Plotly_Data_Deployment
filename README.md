The data analytics shown here reflect research 
focused on bacteria identification for industrial purposes. 
The naval is known to harbor a variety of nonimmunogenic 
bacteria that could serve as viable candidates for sustainable 
food applications. Clients such as Improbable Foods are using 
this analysis to identify strains that can be tested for use 
in vegan meat recipes. Bacteria derived foods can supply 
excellent nutrition and are much less damaging to the environment 
than traditional meat processing.
